/// exiting main, which may result in user application crashes. Instead,
/// complex global objects must be wrapped into GlobalHandler. Its instance
/// is stored on heap, and deallocated when the runtime library is being
/// unloaded.

/// There's no need to store trivial globals here, as no code for their
/// construction or destruction is generated anyway.
